    "* Is there a difference between AI and machine learning? No, the latter is rather a subset of the former.\n",
    "* Many definitions; term probably best should be avoid. One example is agent-based AI.\n",
    "* Input > rules > output: normally it's this direction. For ML we have input and output, and we are looking for the rules.\n",
    "* Bubble chart: AI encompasses ML encompasses ANN (Artificial Neural Networks) / DL (Deep Learning)\n",
    "* Difference ANN and DL: DL are ANN where you have at least one hidden layer\n",
    "* Convolutional Neural Networks: suited for images; much higher accuracy than ML\n",
    "* Computer Science: algorithms programmed\n",
    "* Machine Learning: algorithms used for feature detection, then taken by brain\n",
    "* Deep Learning: brain does everything itself\n",
    "* Tensorflow: data flow graph based library; neural networks are a subset of these graphs"
