    "#### Data Science Workflow\n",
    "\n",
    "See slides: https://gitpitch.com/symeneses/data_science_projects#/\n",
    "\n",
    "Data science typically is an iterative process, both in training and comparing the model and in the overall, long-term improvement of the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Define metrics - both standard metrics (e.g. accuracy) and business metrics (e.g. sales)\n",
    "* Formulate hypothesis (which might also come after data collection in case it's too unclear what data is available in a company)\n",
    "* Collect data\n",
    "* Clean / process data\n",
    "* Engineer feature\n",
    "* Establish baseline; this serves as the benchmark\n",
    "    * E.g. always same amount of sale as yesterday; linear combination of weekday weighting and temperature\n",
    "    * For categorisation: might always be the majority\n",
    "* Select model\n",
    "* Tune parameters\n",
    "* Train model\n",
    "* Compare to baseline\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Project Structure\n",
    "* We need the following folders: _docs_, _tests_, _data_, _output_, _models_, _source_\n",
    "* Easiest is to use the cookiecutter template (see next section for how to do this)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Setting up a Project\n",
    "* Go to command line and go to C:\\Users\\Christian\\git\n",
    "* Execute ```cookiecutter https://github.com/drivendata/cookiecutter-data-science``` and enter the following:\n",
    "    * project: git_exercise_project\n",
    "    * repo: git_exercise\n",
    "* Go to GitHub and create a new repo _git_exercise_\n",
    "* Go to git bash and then to /c/users/christian/git/git_exercise\n",
    "* Initiate repo with ```git init```\n",
    "* Link to remote with ```git remote add origin https://github.com/chriswegmann/git_exercise.git```\n",
    "* Add all files with ```git add .```\n",
    "* Do initial commit of all staged files with ```git commit -m 'initial commit'```\n",
    "* Push repo to GitHub with ```git push -u origin master```\n",
    "\n",
    "Other useful commands:\n",
    "* ```git remote -v``` shows the remote(s)\n",
    "* ```git status``` shows the untracked and staged files\n",
    "* ```git log``` shows the commits\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Creating / merging / deleting branches\n",
    "* Create and check out new branch with ```git checkout -b new_branch```\n",
    "* Go to folder and create new file (or modify an existing file)\n",
    "* Go to git bash and stage new / modified files with ```git add [file]```\n",
    "* Commit staged files with ```git commit -m 'first changes'```\n",
    "* Switch to master branch with ```git checkout master```\n",
    "* Merge new branch to master branch with ```git merge new_branch```\n",
    "* Delete merged branch with ```git branch -d new_branch```\n",
    "* Push repo to GitHub with ```git push origin master```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Pull requests\n",
    "* Go to GitHub and fork the repository you want to contribute\n",
    "* Go to git bash and then to /c/users/christian/git\n",
    "* Clone repository locally with ```git clone https://github.com/chriswegmann/git-initialization-best-practices```\n",
    "* Go to newly created directory\n",
    "* Initialize repo with ```git init```\n",
    "* Add remote of originally forked repo with ```git remote add originally_forked https://github.com/LoKemper/git-initialization-best-practices```\n",
    "* Check if we now have two remotes with ```git remote -v```\n",
    "* Check out a new branch with ```git checkout -b branch_for_pr```\n",
    "* Add / modify file\n",
    "* Stage and commit (see above)\n",
    "* Push branch to origin with ```git push origin branch_for_pr```\n",
    "* Switch to master with ```git checkout master```\n",
    "* Delete branch with ```git branch -D branch_for_pr```\n",
    "* Go to GitHub (https://github.com/chriswegmann/git-initialization-best-practices/pull/new/branch_for_pr) and create a new pull request in the web interface\n",
    "* In order to see it in the originally forked repo go to that folder in the git bash and do again a ```git pull origin master``` - voil√†, the new / modified file is in the local folder.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Update a Forked Repo with Changes from Original\n",
    "* Starting position: we have forked a repo, then the owner of the original repo makes a change. We see that we are one change behind. We want to have this change incorporated as well.\n",
    "* Go to git bash and clone my forked repo through ```git clone https://github.com/chriswegmann/RedBadgePack```\n",
    "* Add the original repo as an upstream remote with ```git remote add upstream https://github.com/Nachzeher/RedBadgePack```\n",
    "* Fetch the data from the upstream remote using ```git fetch upstream```\n",
    "* Update the forked repo with the fetched data from the upstream (original) repo with ```git pull upstream master```\n",
    "* Push to forked repo with ```git push```"
